🏆 Mental Health Sentiment & Emotion Classification
🥉 3rd Place - SRMIST LLM Healthcare Hackathon 2025


📌 Overview
This project is a cutting-edge mental health sentiment and emotion classification system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Designed to analyze social media conversations, patient records, and mental health discussions, the model helps detect emotions, sentiments, and potential signs of mental distress.

🚀 Key Features
✅ Sentiment Analysis: Classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
✅ Emotion Recognition: Detects anger, sadness, happiness, fear, surprise, and disgust.
✅ Mental Health Risk Assessment: Flags potential depression-related content for early intervention.
✅ LLM-Powered Insights: Utilizes Google Gemini API and DistilBERT embeddings for classification.
✅ Scalable & Fast: Optimized for real-time analysis of large datasets.

📊 Tech Stack
LLM Models: Google Gemini API, DistilBERT
NLP Frameworks: Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow/PyTorch
Data Processing: Pandas, NLTK, SpaCy
Deployment: Flask / FastAPI (Optional: Streamlit for UI)
Cloud & Storage: Google Colab, Firebase / AWS
